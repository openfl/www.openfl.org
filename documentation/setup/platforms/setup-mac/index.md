# Setup Mac

## Automatic Install

There is no automatic setup available for Mac.

## Manual Install

In order to build Neko applications for Mac, no further dependencies are required. However, in order to build C++ applications for Mac, you must have a current version of Xcode installed.

You can find Xcode in the Mac App Store.

You can only target Mac from a Mac system right now. If you are interested in contributing to cross-desktop builds to Mac, please visit the [Contributors room](http://www.hipchat.com/ggsrxiqGV) on HipChat.

## Forums

You should not need to install the Xcode command-line tools. If this is not the case, or if you encounter other problems when setting up OpenFL for Mac, please visit the [forums](http://www.openfl.org/community/installing-openfl/).
