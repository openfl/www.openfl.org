                          default behavior of this event is to cause
                          any currently selected text in the text field

                          event to occur, it must always follow this
                          series of events in the order of occurrence:
                          mouseDown event, then mouseUp. The target
                          object must be identical for both of these
                          events; otherwise the `click`
                          event does not occur. Any number of other
                          mouse events can occur at any time between

                          the text context menu. This event is
                          dispatched to the object that currently has
                          focus. If the object that currently has focus
                          is a TextField, the default behavior of this
                          event is to cause any currently selected text
                          in the text field to be copied to the
                          clipboard.

                          the object that currently has focus is a
                          TextField, the default behavior of this event

<p>@event doubleClick            Dispatched when a user presses and releases</p>
<pre><code>                          the main button of a pointing device twice in
                          rapid succession over the same
                          InteractiveObject when that object's
                          `doubleClickEnabled` flag is set
                          to `true`. For a
                          `doubleClick` event to occur, it
                          must immediately follow the following series
                          of events: `mouseDown`,
                          `mouseUp`, `click`,
                          `mouseDown`, `mouseUp`.
                          All of these events must share the same
                          target as the `doubleClick` event.
                          The second click, represented by the second
                          `mouseDown` and
                          `mouseUp` events, must occur
                          within a specific period of time after the
                          `click` event. The allowable
                          length of this period varies by operating
                          system and can often be configured by the
                          user. If the target is a selectable text
                          field, the word under the pointer is selected
                          as the default behavior. If the target
                          InteractiveObject does not have its
                          `doubleClickEnabled` flag set to
                          `true` it receives two
                          `click` events.

                          The `doubleClickEnabled`
                          property defaults to `false`. 

                          The double-click text selection behavior
                          of a TextField object is not related to the
                          `doubleClick` event. Use
                          `TextField.doubleClickEnabled` to
                          control TextField selections.
</code></pre>
<p>@event focusIn                Dispatched <em>after</em> a display object</p>
<pre><code>                          gains focus. This situation happens when a
                          user highlights the object with a pointing
                          device or keyboard navigation. The recipient
                          of such focus is called the target object of
                          this event, while the corresponding
                          InteractiveObject instance that lost focus
                          because of this change is called the related
                          object. A reference to the related object is
                          stored in the receiving object's
                          `relatedObject` property. The
                          `shiftKey` property is not used.
                          This event follows the dispatch of the
                          previous object's `focusOut`
                          event.
</code></pre>
<p>@event focusOut               Dispatched <em>after</em> a display object</p>
<pre><code>                          loses focus. This happens when a user
                          highlights a different object with a pointing
                          device or keyboard navigation. The object
                          that loses focus is called the target object
                          of this event, while the corresponding
                          InteractiveObject instance that receives
                          focus is called the related object. A
                          reference to the related object is stored in
                          the target object's
                          `relatedObject` property. The
                          `shiftKey` property is not used.
                          This event precedes the dispatch of the
                          `focusIn` event by the related
                          object.

<p>@event gesturePan             Dispatched when the user moves a point of</p>
<pre><code>                          contact over the InteractiveObject instance
                          on a touch-enabled device(such as moving a
                          finger from left to right over a display
                          object on a mobile phone or tablet with a
                          touch screen). Some devices might also
                          interpret this contact as a
                          `mouseOver` event and as a
                          `touchOver` event.

                          Specifically, if a user moves a finger
                          over an InteractiveObject, the
                          InteractiveObject instance can dispatch a
                          `mouseOver` event or a
                          `touchOver` event or a
                          `gesturePan` event, or all if the
                          current environment supports it. Choose how
                          you want to handle the user interaction. Use
                          the openfl.ui.Multitouch class to manage touch
                          event handling(enable touch gesture event
                          handling, simple touch point event handling,
                          or disable touch events so only mouse events
                          are dispatched). If you choose to handle the
                          `mouseOver` event, then the same
                          event handler will run on a touch-enabled
                          device and a mouse enabled device. However,
                          if you choose to handle the
                          `gesturePan` event, you can design
                          your event handler to respond to the specific
                          needs of a touch-enabled environment and
                          provide users with a richer touch-enabled
                          experience. You can also handle both events,
                          separately, to provide a different response
                          for a touch event than a mouse event.

                          **Note:** See the Multitouch class for
                          environment compatibility information.

                          might also interpret this contact as a

                          When handling the properties of the event

                          InteractiveObject instance(such as touching
                          two fingers and rotating them over a display
                          object on a mobile phone or tablet with a
                          touch screen). Two-finger rotation is a
                          common rotation gesture, but each device and
                          operating system can have its own
                          requirements to indicate rotation. Some
                          devices might also interpret this contact as
                          a combination of several mouse events, as
                          well.

                          Specifically, if a user moves a finger
                          over an InteractiveObject, the
                          InteractiveObject instance can dispatch a
                          `mouseOver` event and a
                          `click` event(among others), in
                          addition to the `gestureRotate`
                          event, or all if the current environment
                          supports it. Choose how you want to handle
                          the user interaction. Use the
                          openfl.ui.Multitouch class to manage touch
                          event handling(enable touch gesture event
                          handling, simple touch point event handling,
                          or disable touch events so only mouse events
                          are dispatched). If you choose to handle the
                          `mouseOver` event, then the same
                          event handler will run on a touch-enabled

                          if you choose to handle the
                          `gestureRotate` event, you can
                          design your event handler to respond to the
                          specific needs of a touch-enabled environment
                          and provide users with a richer touch-enabled
                          experience. You can also handle both events,
                          separately, to provide a different response
                          for a touch event than a mouse event.

                          When handling the properties of the event
                          object, note that the `localX` and

                          primary point of contact. The
                          `offsetX` and `offsetY`
                          properties are the distance to the point of
                          contact where the rotation gesture is
                          complete.

                          over an InteractiveObject, and then moves the
                          fingers together, the InteractiveObject
                          instance can dispatch a `rollOver`
                          event and a `rollOut` event(among
                          others), in addition to the

                          instance. If the target is a SimpleButton
                          instance, the SimpleButton instance displays
                          the `downState` display object as
                          the default behavior. If the target is a
                          selectable text field, the text field begins
                          selection as the default behavior.

<p>@event mouseFocusChange       Dispatched when the user attempts to change</p>
<pre><code>                          focus by using a pointer device. The default
                          behavior of this event is to change the focus
                          and dispatch the corresponding
                          `focusIn` and
                          `focusOut` events.

                          This event is dispatched to the object
                          that currently has focus. The related object
                          for this event is the InteractiveObject
                          instance that receives focus if you do not
                          prevent the default behavior. You can prevent
                          the change in focus by calling
                          `preventDefault()` in an event
                          listener that is properly registered with the
                          target object. The `shiftKey`
                          property is not used. Focus changes and
                          `focusIn` and
                          `focusOut` events are dispatched
                          by default.

                          is selecting, the selection is updated as the
                          default behavior.

<pre><code>                          device away from an InteractiveObject
                          instance. The event target is the object
                          previously under the pointing device. The
                          `relatedObject` is the object the
                          pointing device has moved to. If the target
                          is a SimpleButton instance, the button
                          displays the `upState` display
                          object as the default behavior.

                          The `mouseOut` event is
                          dispatched each time the mouse leaves the
                          area of any child object of the display
                          object container, even if the mouse remains
                          over another child object of the display
                          object container. This is different behavior
                          than the purpose of the `rollOut`
                          event, which is to simplify the coding of
                          rollover behaviors for display object
                          containers with children. When the mouse
                          leaves the area of a display object or the
                          area of any of its children to go to an
                          object that is not one of its children, the
                          display object dispatches the
                          `rollOut` event.The
                          `rollOut` events are dispatched
                          consecutively up the parent chain of the
                          object, starting with the object and ending
                          with the highest parent that is neither the
                          root nor an ancestor of the

<pre><code>                          device over an InteractiveObject instance.
                          The `relatedObject` is the object
                          that was previously under the pointing
                          device. If the target is a SimpleButton
                          instance, the object displays the
                          `overState` or
                          `upState` display object,
                          depending on whether the mouse button is
                          down, as the default behavior.

                          The `mouseOver` event is
                          dispatched each time the mouse enters the
                          area of any child object of the display
                          object container, even if the mouse was
                          already over another child object of the
                          display object container. This is different
                          behavior than the purpose of the
                          `rollOver` event, which is to
                          simplify the coding of rollout behaviors for
                          display object containers with children. When
                          the mouse enters the area of a display object
                          or the area of any of its children from an
                          object that is not one of its children, the
                          display object dispatches the
                          `rollOver` event. The
                          `rollOver` events are dispatched

                          is neither the root nor an ancestor of the
                          `relatedObject` and ending with

                          The event's dropAction property indicates
                          the action set by the drag target object; a
                          value of "none"
                         (`DragActions.NONE`) indicates
                          that the drop was canceled or was not
                          accepted.

                          The `nativeDragComplete` event
                          handler is a convenient place to update the
                          state of the initiating display object, for
                          example, by removing an item from a list(on
                          a drag action of "move"), or by changing the

                          the drop has been accepted with a call to
                          DragManager.acceptDragDrop().

                          Access the dropped data using the event
                          object `clipboard` property.

                          The handler for this event should set the
                          `DragManager.dropAction` property
                          to provide feedback to the initiator object
                          about which drag action was taken. If no
                          value is set, the DragManager will select a
                          default value from the list of allowed

                          To determine whether the dispatching

                          dispatches the `rollOut` event.
                          This is different behavior than that of the
                          `mouseOut` event, which is
                          dispatched each time the mouse leaves the
                          area of any child object of the display
                          object container, even if the mouse remains

<pre><code>                          device over an InteractiveObject instance.
                          The event target is the object under the
                          pointing device or a parent of that object.
                          The `relatedObject` is the object
                          that was previously under the pointing
                          device. The `rollOver` events are
                          dispatched consecutively down the parent
                          chain of the object, starting with the
                          highest parent that is neither the root nor
                          an ancestor of the `relatedObject`
                          and ending with the object.

                          The purpose of the `rollOver`
                          event is to simplify the coding of rollout
                          behaviors for display object containers with
                          children. When the mouse enters the area of a
                          display object or the area of any of its
                          children from an object that is not one of
                          its children, the display object dispatches
                          the `rollOver` event. This is
                          different behavior than that of the
                          `mouseOver` event, which is
                          dispatched each time the mouse enters the
                          area of any child object of the display
                          object container, even if the mouse was
                          already over another child object of the
                          display object container.

                          is dispatched to the object that currently

<p>The <code>blendMode</code> property affects each pixel of the display

Flash Player or Adobe AIR compares each constituent color of one pixel in

to the bitmap instead of the main display. If
<code>cacheAsBitmapMatrix</code> is null or unsupported, the bitmap is
then copied to the main display as unstretched, unrotated pixels snapped
to the nearest pixel boundaries. Pixels are mapped 1 to 1 with the parent
object. If the bounds of the bitmap change, the bitmap is recreated
instead of being stretched.</p>
<p>If <code>cacheAsBitmapMatrix</code> is non-null and supported, the
object is drawn to the off-screen bitmap using that matrix and the
stretched and/or rotated results of that rendering are used to draw the
object to the main display.</p>
<p>No internal bitmap is created unless the <code>cacheAsBitmap</code>
property is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>After you set the <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> property to
<code>true</code>, the rendering does not change, however the display
object performs pixel snapping automatically. The animation speed can be
significantly faster depending on the complexity of the vector content.</p>
<p>The <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> property is automatically set to
<code>true</code> whenever you apply a filter to a display object(when
its <code>filter</code> array is not empty), and if a display object has a
filter applied to it, <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> is reported as
<code>true</code> for that display object, even if you set the property to
<code>false</code>. If you clear all filters for a display object, the
<code>cacheAsBitmap</code> setting changes to what it was last set to.</p>
<p>A display object does not use a bitmap even if the
<code>cacheAsBitmap</code> property is set to <code>true</code> and
instead renders from vector data in the following cases:</p><ul><li>The bitmap is too large. In AIR 1.5 and Flash Player 10, the maximum
size for a bitmap image is 8,191 pixels in width or height, and the total
number of pixels cannot exceed 16,777,215 pixels.(So, if a bitmap image
is 8,191 pixels wide, it can only be 2,048 pixels high.) In Flash Player 9
and earlier, the limitation is is 2880 pixels in height and 2,880 pixels
in width.</li><li>The bitmap fails to allocate(out of memory error). </li></ul>
<p>The <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> property is best used with movie clips
that have mostly static content and that do not scale and rotate
frequently. With such movie clips, <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> can lead to
performance increases when the movie clip is translated(when its <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> position is changed).</p></div></div><div class="field "><a name="filters"></a><h3><p><code><span class="label">read only</span><span class="label">write only</span><a href="../../openfl/display/DisplayObject.html#filters"><span class="identifier">filters</span></a>:<a class="type" title="An Array is a storage for values." href="../../Array.html">Array</a>&lt;<a class="type" title="The BitmapFilter class is the base class for all image filter effects." href="../../openfl/filters/BitmapFilter.html">BitmapFilter</a>&gt;</code></p></h3><div class="doc"><p>An indexed array that contains each filter object currently associated
with the display object. The openfl.filters package contains several
classes that define specific filters you can use.</p>
<p>Filters can be applied in Flash Professional at design time, or at run
time by using ActionScript code. To apply a filter by using ActionScript,
you must make a temporary copy of the entire <code>filters</code> array,
modify the temporary array, then assign the value of the temporary array
back to the <code>filters</code> array. You cannot directly add a new
filter object to the <code>filters</code> array.</p>
<p>To add a filter by using ActionScript, perform the following steps
(assume that the target display object is named
<code>myDisplayObject</code>):</p><ol><li>Create a new filter object by using the constructor method of your
chosen filter class.</li><li>Assign the value of the <code>myDisplayObject.filters</code> array
to a temporary array, such as one named <code>myFilters</code>.</li><li>Add the new filter object to the <code>myFilters</code> temporary
array.</li><li>Assign the value of the temporary array to the
<code>myDisplayObject.filters</code> array.</li></ol>
<p>If the <code>filters</code> array is undefined, you do not need to use
a temporary array. Instead, you can directly assign an array literal that
contains one or more filter objects that you create. The first example in
the Examples section adds a drop shadow filter by using code that handles
both defined and undefined <code>filters</code> arrays.</p>
<p>To modify an existing filter object, you must use the technique of
modifying a copy of the <code>filters</code> array:</p><ol><li>Assign the value of the <code>filters</code> array to a temporary
array, such as one named <code>myFilters</code>.</li><li>Modify the property by using the temporary array,
<code>myFilters</code>. For example, to set the quality property of the
first filter in the array, you could use the following code:
<code>myFilters[0].quality = 1;</code></li><li>Assign the value of the temporary array to the <code>filters</code>
array.</li></ol>
<p>At load time, if a display object has an associated filter, it is
marked to cache itself as a transparent bitmap. From this point forward,
as long as the display object has a valid filter list, the player caches
the display object as a bitmap. This source bitmap is used as a source
image for the filter effects. Each display object usually has two bitmaps:
one with the original unfiltered source display object and another for the
final image after filtering. The final image is used when rendering. As
long as the display object does not change, the final image does not need
updating.</p>
<p>The openfl.filters package includes classes for filters. For example, to
create a DropShadow filter, you would write:</p><p class="javadoc">Throws:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><div class="indent inline-content"><tr><th width="25%"><code>ArgumentError</code></th><td><p>When <code>filters</code> includes a ShaderFilter

<p>When display objects are cached by setting the

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A single <code>mask</code> object cannot be used to mask
more than one calling display object. When the <code>mask</code> is
assigned to a second display object, it is removed as the mask of the

Transform class.</p>
<p>Each of the transform object's properties is itself an object. This
concept is important because the only way to set new values for the matrix
or colorTransform objects is to create a new object and copy that object
into the transform.matrix or transform.colorTransform property.</p>
<p>For example, to increase the <code>tx</code> value of a display
object's matrix, you must make a copy of the entire matrix object, then
copy the new object into the matrix property of the transform object:
<code> var myMatrix:<a href="../../openfl/geom/Matrix.html">Matrix</a> =
myDisplayObject.transform.matrix; myMatrix.tx += 10;
myDisplayObject.transform.matrix = myMatrix; </code></p>
<p>You cannot directly set the <code>tx</code> property. The following
code has no effect on <code>myDisplayObject</code>: 
<code> myDisplayObject.transform.matrix.tx +=
10; </code></p>
<p>You can also copy an entire transform object and assign it to another
display object's transform property. For example, the following code
copies the entire transform object from <code>myOldDisplayObj</code> to
<code>myNewDisplayObj</code>:
<code>myNewDisplayObj.transform = myOldDisplayObj.transform;</code></p>

the listener receives notification of an event. You can register event
listeners on all nodes in the display list for a specific type of event,
phase, and priority.</p>
<p>After you successfully register an event listener, you cannot change
its priority through additional calls to <code>addEventListener()</code>.
To change a listener's priority, you must first call
<code>removeListener()</code>. Then you can register the listener again
with the new priority level. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that after the listener is registered, subsequent calls to
<code>addEventListener()</code> with a different <code>type</code> or
<code>useCapture</code> value result in the creation of a separate
listener registration. For example, if you first register a listener with
<code>useCapture</code> set to <code>true</code>, it listens only during
the capture phase. If you call <code>addEventListener()</code> again using
the same listener object, but with <code>useCapture</code> set to
<code>false</code>, you have two separate listeners: one that listens
during the capture phase and another that listens during the target and
bubbling phases. </p>
<p>You cannot register an event listener for only the target phase or the
bubbling phase. Those phases are coupled during registration because
bubbling applies only to the ancestors of the target node.</p>
<p>If you no longer need an event listener, remove it by calling
<code>removeEventListener()</code>, or memory problems could result. Event
listeners are not automatically removed from memory because the garbage
collector does not remove the listener as long as the dispatching object
exists(unless the <code>useWeakReference</code> parameter is set to
<code>true</code>).</p>
<p>Copying an EventDispatcher instance does not copy the event listeners
attached to it.(If your newly created node needs an event listener, you
must attach the listener after creating the node.) However, if you move an
EventDispatcher instance, the event listeners attached to it move along
with it.</p>
<p>If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event is
being processed on this node, the event listener is not triggered during
the current phase but can be triggered during a later phase in the event
flow, such as the bubbling phase.</p>
<p>If an event listener is removed from a node while an event is being
processed on the node, it is still triggered by the current actions. After
it is removed, the event listener is never invoked again(unless
registered again for future processing). </p><p class="javadoc">Parameters:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><tr><th width="25%"><code>type</code></th><td><p>The type of event.</p></td></tr><tr><th width="25%"><code>useCapture</code></th><td><p>Determines whether the listener works in the

If <code>useCapture</code> is set to
<code>true</code>, the listener processes the
event only during the capture phase and not in the
target or bubbling phase. If
<code>useCapture</code> is <code>false</code>, the
listener processes the event only during the
target or bubbling phase. To listen for the event
in all three phases, call
<code>addEventListener</code> twice, once with
<code>useCapture</code> set to <code>true</code>,

<code>false</code>.</p></td></tr><tr><th width="25%"><code>priority</code></th><td><p>The priority level of the event listener. The
priority is designated by a signed 32-bit integer.
The higher the number, the higher the priority.
All listeners with priority <em>n</em> are processed
before listeners of priority <em>n</em>-1. If two or
more listeners share the same priority, they are
processed in the order in which they were added.
The default priority is 0.</p></td></tr><tr><th width="25%"><code>useWeakReference</code></th><td><p>Determines whether the reference to the listener

<p>Class-level member functions are not subject to
garbage collection, so you can set
<code>useWeakReference</code> to <code>true</code>
for class-level member functions without
subjecting them to garbage collection. If you set
<code>useWeakReference</code> to <code>true</code>
for a listener that is a nested inner function,
the function will be garbage-collected and no
longer persistent. If you create references to the
inner function(save it in another variable) then
it is not garbage-collected and stays
persistent.</p></td></tr></table><p class="javadoc">Throws:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><div class="indent inline-content"><tr><th width="25%"><code>ArgumentError</code></th><td><p>The <code>listener</code> specified is not a
