# Setup HTML5

## Automatic Install

There is no automatic setup available for HTML5.

## Manual Install

There is generally no setup required for the HTML5 target, but it may vary depending upon the HTML5 backend you use. For example, in order to use the unofficial "openfl-bitfive" backend, you must also install "openfl-bitfive" from haxelib, and include `<haxelib name="openfl-bitfive" />`, before `<haxelib name="openfl" />`
