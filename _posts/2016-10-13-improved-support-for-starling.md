title: Improved Support for Starling 
---

We are proud to announce that a new version of Starling 1.8 has been released on Haxelib!

This release was made possible by the work of Pete Shand and the "haxeling" project, and major improvements to core OpenFL support for Stage3D APIs, contributed by Zynga, vroad and other members of the OpenFL team.

OpenFL 4.3.1 is now available, correcting minor issues affecting the Starling demo.
